fcamera (0.1.7-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * "Fixed" in fcam-dev: Thumbnails are now readable by dcraw (and derived libraries like libraw). Once again, dcraw fails to follow the tiff spec.
	
  * Made the LED blinker clean up after itself (so that regular notifications work after using fcamera), and gave it better error handling.
